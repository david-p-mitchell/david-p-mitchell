## Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer from the UK, specialising in **C#**, **SQL**, **Vue.js**, **Nuxt.js**, and **.NET Core**. I enjoy building real-world projects and learning new technologies.

My [portfolio website](https://david-p-mitchell.uk) showcases some of my work and provides more information about me.

#### I'm currently working on:
Enon Baptist Church's website using **Nuxt.js**. [Source code](https://github.com/EnonBaptistChurch/ebcc-web-static)
